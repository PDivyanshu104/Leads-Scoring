Leads-Scoring

X Education is an online platform which sells online courses to the customers. The most 
impacting challenge faced by X Education was that the lead conversion rate was poor although 
they get a lot of leads.
To target lead conversion rate given by the CEO is 80%. To address this issue, we have built a 
model to identify the leads based on certain parameters.
To build the model, we have taken several steps. Initially, the given data was cleaned up by 
removing the skewed variables, incorrect information and variables/rows which was of least 
importance. After cleaning the data, we have analyzed it to understand the factors which have a 
significant impact on the lead conversion. 
Data preparation was done by creating the dummy variables for certain categorical variables. 
Few continuous variables were rescaled to get better values. Then, the data was divided into train 
and test sets.
Using Recursive Feature Elimination we eliminated few variables which were of least 
importance. We created models and eliminated a variable based on the VIF factor and p-value. 
The final model comprised of 11 variables. The modelâ€™s performance was assessed using the 
overall accuracy and sensitivity of both train and test sets.
Based on the findings, there are certain recommendations to work on the improvement of lead 
conversion. The X Education can focus more on advertising through the Welingak Website, 
offering better offers and discounts for the candidates likely to be converted to a lead. The 
marketing team should make calls to the candidates who spent more time on the website.
Overall, it was an insightful experience working on this project. Understanding the data, cleaning 
the data, visualizing the data, preparing the data, building, analyzing and evaluating the model, 
gaining insights based on the final model
